# 2021-22 CST1500 Computer Systems Architecture and Operating Systems
## Coursework requirements:
Students will have to write the code up to good programming standards (correct naming, 
indentation, comments in code), present it to lab tutors in week 8 lab session and submit it 
online by the end of week 8.
Students are supposed to use parts of C programming learned in lab sessions (loops, if statements, variables, functions), but they are encouraged to use any new technologies that
were not explicitly taught in lab sessions.
Final assessment will be done in lab session of week 8, students will be supposed to bring the
code to the lab session (mail, OneDrive or memory stick), compile it during the presentation, 
run the code to show itâ€™s functional and explain features of the code. Students will be given 
exact timeslots during the session to be able to accommodate high volume of students. No 
presence in a given time slot will result in fail mark

## Technical Requirements
Topic 1: Dice rolling
Students are supposed to develop a program that will be generating random numbers based on 
the user inputs. Program is supposed to ask user for a number of faces of a dice and a number 
of throws.
Where stdout is an output of the program and stdin is input of the user. Program is supposed 
to generate random numbers between 1 and a number of faces and simulate throws based on 
number of throws given by the user. Program is supposed to store the number of occurrences 
of each number and calculate percentage of occurrence of each number.
